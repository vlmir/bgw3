# 'prm_txn.tsv' provides mappings between reference proteome IDs and taxon IDs, needed for downloading and processing data from some sources.
# It was extracted from 'ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/reference_proteomes/README' (tab delimited) for the species currently used in BioGateway.
# The file is parsed by util.MakeMap function. The function can use any character but '#' as a delimiter and arbitrary fields as keys and values.
# NB: some mappings may eventually change, should be checked in case of problems downloading UniProt data !!
